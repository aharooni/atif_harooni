                    <strong>Project Aim:</strong>
                    Modeling the temperature of a shielding gas trail cup during additive manufacturing process to 
                    reduce oxidation and improve weld quality.                
                </p>
                <p><strong>
                    Background: 
                </strong>
                During metal additive manufacturing process, some oxidation was observed. Temperature measurements were 
                taken during each pass on the shielding gas trail cup. It was thought that since the shielding gas trail 
                cup was getting too hot, it was creating convection currents and disrupting the shielding effects of the argon gas.

                Goal of this analysis is to make a model of the shield gas trail cup. By keeping the temperature below a certain point 
                would reduce the convection flow, and allow the shield gas assembly to work properly.

                Sample calculation result. The plot shows how the temperature increases as a function of passes. By modifying the 
                inputs, welds can be created in a way to keep the temperature below a threshold. Welds created below this threshold 
                should have less oxidation due to minimal convection flow.

                This calculation adds certain methods to reduce trail gas cup temperature. This is done by adding a prolonged rest 
                period after a certain amount of passes.
